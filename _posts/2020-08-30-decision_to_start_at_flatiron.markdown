I've been working at a software consultancy with developers and UX/UI designers for years now. I'm a project manager and I've been left longing for more concrete involvment on projects. I want to create something, solve a problem, be creative. Currently my most creative tasks are writing emails to explain the concepts of agile software development to clients. 

I also write what are called 'stories' for developers to pull down and work on. Stories are a narrative that explains how a peice of functionality should work, what exactly it should do, and if there are any constraints, complications, or other considerations. Each time I write these stories I wonder what it's like to actually work through one. To be able to spend time solving a problem and creating something. 

The first time I started toying around with writing code was 4 years ago. I know that because the other day I happened upon my first github entry, and it was from 4 years ago, the first time I tried to learn. If I would have stuck with it then I'd be in a very different place today. I'd be solidly in a career that I can be creative in. Instead I'm managing projects, which can be fun, but often just feels like hearding cats. It's time for me to stick with this, learn, and power through until I'm where I want to be.
